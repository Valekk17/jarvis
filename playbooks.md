# Agent Playbooks

## Active Multi-Chat Engagement & Coordination
**Trigger:** Valek initiates or participates in active communication across multiple Telegram chats, especially during focused work periods (e.g., the concentrated activity observed on February 15th).
**Frequency:** Ad-hoc, with noticeable spikes in activity; often daily or during specific project sprints when communication is crucial.
**Goal:** To efficiently manage, track, and synchronize ongoing discussions, extract critical information, facilitate timely responses, and ensure comprehensive coverage across all relevant Telegram communication channels.

### Workflow
1.  Valek monitors and scans multiple Telegram chats for updates and new messages.
2.  Valek reads and comprehends incoming messages from various participants across different discussions.
3.  Valek drafts and sends messages, replies, or shares information.
4.  Valek potentially coordinates information or tasks that span across different chats and projects.
5.  Valek keeps track of conversational context and open items across numerous discussions simultaneously.

### Agent Actions
-   **Real-time Monitoring & Alerting:** Continuously monitor all designated "key Telegram chats" (e.g., chat IDs 838471791, 8514352345, 448734328, etc.) for new messages, direct mentions, or critical keywords. Alert Valek to high-priority items or unanswered questions.
-   **Contextual Summarization:** Proactively offer concise summaries of unread messages or significant developments within individual chats, particularly after periods of inactivity or during high-volume days.
-   **Cross-Chat Information Synthesis:** When Valek is actively engaged, identify potential overlaps, related discussions, or conflicting information across different active chats to provide a holistic view.
-   **Intelligent Response Suggestion:** Based on the current chat context, Valek's communication history, and any available project knowledge, suggest quick replies, draft message snippets, or retrieve relevant information to aid Valek in composing responses.
-   **Follow-up & Task Identification:** Suggest potential follow-up actions, highlight open questions, or identify tasks arising from conversations across multiple chats, and offer to create reminders or add to a task list.
-   **Information Archiving & Retrieval:** Ensure all critical information, decisions, and action items discussed across chats are indexed and easily retrievable upon Valek's request (e.g., "What was decided about [topic] in [chat]?" or "Find all mentions of [keyword] across my chats last week.").
-   **Proactive Information Bridging:** If a piece of information from one chat appears highly relevant or critical to an ongoing discussion in another (with Valek's permission), proactively highlight or offer to bridge that information.
